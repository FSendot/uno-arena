# Local GitLab Runner and Staging Runbook

This runbook covers two local lanes:

1. **Kind foundation (Slice 0)** — disposable datastores + bootstrap Jobs under
   namespace `uno-arena`. Foundation datastores + bootstrap Jobs; service
   durable adapters for every context are deployed by the complete lane. CDC prerequisites
   (logical WAL, CDC roles/publications, kind-short retention + DLQ topic
   scaffolding) plus Debezium Kafka Connect (four outbox routers) and Debezium
   Server (Room realtime → Redis) manifests are in place; live outbox→topic /
   outbox→Redis delivery proofs and Analytics/Spectator Kafka consumers have
   separate explicit live checks (status scripts alone still do not claim delivery).
2. **Identity staging smoke** — existing GitLab runner + Helm deploy of Identity
   into `staging` (unchanged checkpoint path).

## Prerequisites

- Docker running locally.
- `gitlab-runner` installed and registered to the GitLab project (for the Identity
  staging smoke path).
- `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `docker`, `bash`, `ruby`, and `curl` available on the
  runner host.
- A GitLab token with `read_registry` permission if the project registry is
  private.

## Kind Foundation (Slice 0)

Authority: `docs/architecture/*`, ADR-0027/0028/0030/0031/0035, and
`infrastructure/kind/README.md`.

### What this lane provides

- Kind cluster name `uno-arena` / kubectl context `kind-uno-arena`.
- Namespace `uno-arena` aligned with Helm discovery
  (`*.uno-arena.svc.cluster.local`).
- Four physically separate disposable Postgres instances/databases:
  `identity`, `room_gameplay`, `tournament`, `ranking`.
- Single-node Kafka KRaft broker with **RF1 / minISR1** (explicit non-HA).
- Redis with local AOF (`appendonly yes`, `appendfsync everysec` under
  emptyDir `/data/appendonlydir`) so same-pod Redis container restart can
  reload recent keys; architecture-selected digest-pinned KurrentDB 26.0.3
  (reviewed AMD64 image or local-only experimental ARM64 image), ClickHouse,
  and Keycloak 26.7.0 `start-dev` with a minimal `unoarena` realm/client/test
  user.
- Bootstrap Jobs for Identity/Room/Tournament/Ranking Postgres, Analytics
  ClickHouse, and AsyncAPI-derived Kafka topics (plus Connect internal topics,
  kind-short `retention.ms` by ADR-0032 class, and consumer-owned DLQ topic
  scaffolding).
- Debezium Kafka Connect 3.6.0.Final (exact quay.io multi-architecture index
  staged by node-native `crictl pull`, with the runtime resolving the reviewed
  AMD64 or ARM64 child, via `make kind-load-debezium-connect`;
  `imagePullPolicy: Never` — workload never pulls) with an
  idempotent Job registering exactly four PostgreSQL Outbox Event Router connectors
  (identity / room integration / tournament / ranking) using `snapshot.mode=no_data`.
  `kind-apply` deletes the registration Job before recreate so config changes
  re-run. Stage via `make kind-load-debezium-connect` before apply.
  `make kind-test-debezium-connectors` checks Connect REST status only — it does
  not prove end-to-end delivery.
- Debezium Server for Room realtime → Redis (separate from Connect; Redis offsets
  with a unique key, no schema-history store, official `debezium.format.*`
  properties, `snapshot.mode=no_data`; same node-native digest stage / Never
  pattern via `make kind-load-debezium-server`). `kind-apply` applies the Server
  manifests, then namespace-scoped `rollout restart` of
  `deployment/debezium-server-room-realtime` only (ConfigMap changes do not
  restart a healthy pod by themselves), then waits for rollout.
  Optional live probes (not claimed by validate):
  `make kind-test-debezium-postgres-to-kafka-live` and
  `make kind-test-debezium-postgres-to-redis-live`.
- Postgres instances enable `wal_level=logical` with bounded local replication
  slots/senders; bootstrap creates least-privilege CDC roles/publications per
  outbox (Room: separate Kafka vs realtime CDC identities). **No logical slots
  in bootstrap** — Debezium owns slot lifecycle.
- Disposable `emptyDir` storage only — no PVC/backup claim. Redis AOF does
  **not** make Redis authoritative: pod replacement or `kind-reset` may lose
  emptyDir data and projections/timers must rebuild from Kafka/Postgres.
- ClusterIP Services only. Ingress host ports `8080→80` / `8443→443` are
  reserved on the kind node for a later local ingress controller; this slice
  does not install ingress or claim production ingress.

### Offline checks (no pull, no cluster)

```bash
make kind-render
make kind-validate
./infrastructure/kind/scripts/clean-deploy.sh --dry-run
```

The dry-run prints the reset/create/build/load/apply/deploy/probe sequence and
does not contact Docker, a registry, or Kubernetes.

### Complete clean-cluster lane

This is the acceptance lane for the disposable local environment. It is pinned
to cluster `uno-arena` / context `kind-uno-arena` and refuses to start without
the literal reset confirmation:

```bash
./infrastructure/kind/scripts/clean-deploy.sh --confirm-reset uno-arena
```

It performs, in order:

1. validate offline and preflight all required tools plus the Docker architecture before deletion;
2. delete only kind cluster `uno-arena`, require at least 20 GiB of host filesystem
   headroom, and then recreate it;
3. build/load the bootstrap and all eight `uno-arena/*:local` service images;
4. fail closed unless the kind node is AMD64 or ARM64 and select the matching
   reviewed digest-pinned KurrentDB 26.0.3 image;
5. stage the exact Debezium Connect and Server multi-architecture indexes and
   verify that the node resolved their matching AMD64 or ARM64 children;
6. apply/wait for datastores, schema/topic bootstrap, Connect, and Server;
7. deploy MinIO plus Alloy, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus, kube-state-metrics, and
   Grafana, then wait for the complete observability stack;
8. deploy Identity, Game Integrity, Ranking, Tournament, Analytics, Spectator,
   Room, and finally Gateway with their kind Helm overlays; and
9. run observability baseline/security/persistence checks, prove the three
   authoritative player/game/tournament counters and canonical cross-context
   trace, run all eight client-parity phases, then run CDC delivery, durable
   adapter, ephemeral-store integration, Kafka-to-ClickHouse, recovery-worker,
   Redis projection, Gateway admission, and AOF probes.

This command is destructive to the disposable cluster and requires networked
image access. `--skip-probes` may be used for startup diagnosis, but is not a
successful acceptance run.

Observed acceptance status: the clean foundation, full observability stack, and
all eight services have deployed successfully on a reviewed node architecture;
the three business counters, canonical trace, centralized-log linkage, and
Loki/Tempo/MinIO recovery paths passed. Connect and Server CDC ran live, and the
Analytics and Spectator end-to-end projection-rebuilder proofs passed. The kind
overlays enable those two rebuilders, while default/staging/production overlays
do not. The Stage B CLI completed a live casual best-of-three and a live
tournament end to end, including assignment, Room play, asynchronous result
consumption, lifecycle advancement, and terminal `TournamentCompleted`.

For local CLI seeding, kind Identity uses an explicitly environment-gated,
context-owned password test-account stub. This is a disposable exercise seam,
not the production authentication model: staging and production are OIDC-only.

### Explicit cluster lifecycle

Create, apply, and reset are **never** implied by validate:

```bash
make kind-create-cluster
make kind-install-istio
make kind-build-load-bootstrap
./infrastructure/kind/scripts/build-load-services.sh
make kind-load-debezium-connect
make kind-load-debezium-server
make kind-apply
make kind-wait
make kind-deploy-observability
./infrastructure/kind/scripts/deploy-services.sh
# ... local experiments ...
make kind-reset
```

Scripts refuse to run apply/wait against any kubectl context other than
`kind-uno-arena`. `make kind-reset` hard-pins cluster `uno-arena` and context
`kind-uno-arena` and rejects `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` / `KIND_CONTEXT_NAME` overrides.

`make kind-apply` waits for datastore readiness before starting bootstrap Jobs
so Job backoff is not consumed by store startup.

### Local-only credentials

Kubernetes Secret `uno-arena-local-credentials` holds obvious placeholder
passwords for admin/bootstrap/runtime roles. They are **not** production
secrets. Runtime DB roles are created without DDL privilege; bootstrap Jobs use
dedicated DDL credentials and Postgres advisory locks (ADR-0027).

### Out of scope for this slice

- Production mesh policy, PVC/HA/backup, and production capacity planning.
- A green offline validation is not a live delivery claim; use the complete
  clean-cluster lane for CDC, Kafka-consumer, and datastore acceptance evidence.

### Explicit Room / Identity durable adapter targets (after kind-wait)

```bash
make kind-deploy-identity          # Identity durable (schema-gated /ready)
make kind-deploy-room-gameplay     # Room durable + timer worker (kind values)
make test-room-helm                # offline Helm lint/template
make kind-test-room-adapter-structure
make kind-test-room-integration    # ephemeral unoarena_room_gameplay_test_* only
```

Do **not** auto-reset the authoritative `room_gameplay` database when running
live integration later; the harness creates/drops only its ephemeral test DB.

## Runner Selection

Use a project runner with the shell executor for the local Identity checkpoint
run. In GitLab, open the project and go to **Settings -> CI/CD -> Runners**.

Recommended local setup:

- Enable the local project runner.
- Disable shared instance runners for this project while validating the local
  pipeline, or use a dedicated runner tag and add the same tag to the jobs.
- If the jobs are untagged, make sure the local runner is allowed to run
  untagged jobs.

Expected job log when the local runner is selected:

```text
Running on <local-runner-name>...
```

If the log shows a different host, GitLab selected a
shared SaaS runner instead of the local runner.

Start the local runner in a terminal:

```bash
gitlab-runner run
```

The runner stops at `Initializing executor providers`. At
that point it is waiting for GitLab to assign jobs.

## Local Kubernetes Context (Identity staging smoke)

For the Identity staging pipeline path, ensure the active context is the local
kind cluster (created via `make kind-create-cluster` or equivalent):

```bash
kubectl config use-context kind-uno-arena
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get nodes
```

The shell runner uses the host's active `kubectl` context. Before running a
pipeline, verify the active context points at `kind-uno-arena`.

Foundation datastores live in namespace `uno-arena`. The Identity Helm smoke
path below continues to use namespace `staging` and does not require the
foundation Jobs to be green for the current health-only Identity chart.

## GitLab Registry Pull Secret

The deploy job pins the image by digest, for example:
`registry.gitlab.com/<group>/<project>/identity@sha256:<digest>`.

If the GitLab registry is private, the local cluster needs credentials to pull
that image:

```bash
kubectl create namespace staging --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl -n staging create secret docker-registry gitlab-registry \
  --docker-server=registry.gitlab.com \
  --docker-username=<gitlab-username-or-deploy-token-user> \
  --docker-password=<read_registry_token> \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl -n staging patch serviceaccount default \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets":[{"name":"gitlab-registry"}]}'
```

Do not commit registry tokens or paste token values into project docs.

## GitLab CI Variables

Set the variables in **Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables**.

| Variable | Value for local checkpoint run | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STAGING_IDENTITY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:18080` | Not secret. For a first local proof, leave masked off and protected off unless the branch and runner are both configured for protected variables. |

The CI job maps `STAGING_IDENTITY_URL` into `UNOARENA_API_URL` for
`devops-checkpoint/smoke-test/run-smoke-test.sh`. Do not set
`UNOARENA_API_URL` directly in GitLab for the normal pipeline path.

`UNOARENA_CLI_BIN` is no longer needed. The integration job installs the
Client Checkpoint CLI artifact from `client-checkpoint/bin/unoarena`.

## Running The Identity Staging Pipeline

1. Start the runner:

   ```bash
   gitlab-runner run
   ```

2. Ensure the local cluster context is active:

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context kind-uno-arena
   ```

3. Push to GitLab or run a manual web pipeline from the GitLab UI.

4. Keep a second terminal ready for the Identity service port-forward. Start it
   once `deploy-staging:identity` has created the service, or leave this wait
   loop running before retrying `integration-staging:identity`:

   ```bash
   until kubectl get svc identity -n staging >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done
   kubectl port-forward svc/identity 18080:80 -n staging
   ```

   The port-forward must run on the same host as the shell runner. That is why
   the GitLab variable uses `http://127.0.0.1:18080`.

5. Confirm the Identity staging rollout and smoke test:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment/identity -n staging --timeout=120s
   kubectl logs deployment/identity -n staging
   ```

6. After a green run, update `devops-checkpoint/README.md` with the real GitLab
   pipeline URL in the **Pipeline Run** section.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `UNOARENA_API_URL: UNOARENA_API_URL must be set` | `STAGING_IDENTITY_URL` is missing, empty, or unavailable to the pipeline. | Add `STAGING_IDENTITY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080` in GitLab CI variables. Check protected-variable settings. |
| Job log shows `saas-linux-small-amd64` or `docker+machine` | GitLab selected a shared runner. | Disable shared runners for the project, or add matching tags to the local runner and jobs. |
| `ImagePullBackOff` in `staging` | `kind` cannot pull the private GitLab registry image. | Create or refresh the `gitlab-registry` image pull secret in the `staging` namespace. |
| Smoke test cannot connect to `127.0.0.1:18080` | The port-forward is not running on the runner host. | Start `kubectl port-forward svc/identity 18080:80 -n staging` before retrying the integration job. |
| `apk` command not found | The job is running under the shell executor, not inside Alpine. | This is expected; the script only runs `apk` when it exists. If it still fails, check the exact failing command in the job log. |
| kind script refuses context | Current kubectl context is not `kind-uno-arena`. | `kubectl config use-context kind-uno-arena` or create the cluster with `make kind-create-cluster`. |
| `make kind-validate` fails on Kafka plan | Generated artifacts missing or drifted. | Run `make kind-render` then `make kind-validate`. |
| Kafka broker logs STARTED but Service has no ready endpoints / probe timeouts | Readiness used heavy `kafka-topics.sh` exec probes that hang while plaintext 9092 is already listening. | Kind manifests use `tcpSocket:9092` readiness/liveness; topic drift stays in `bootstrap-kafka-topics`. Re-apply `30-kafka` or full kind apply. |
| KurrentDB FTL unknown options `ServicePortHttpGrpc` / `Port2113Tcp*` after successful startup | Service-link env vars (`KURRENTDB_*`) collide with Kurrent configuration. | Pod must set `enableServiceLinks: false` under `spec.template.spec`. Re-apply `40-kurrentdb`. |
| `bootstrap-clickhouse-analytics` fails with ClickHouse Code 62 `Multi-statements are not allowed` | Full migration SQL was POSTed as one HTTP body after the default sentinel. | Bootstrap splits `001_init.sql` and POSTs one statement per request (no `multiquery=1`). After a partial apply, run `make kind-reset` then re-apply. |
| `kind-load-debezium-*` fails with stale kind-import metadata / `docker.io/library/import-*` in `repoDigests` | Prior `kind load` poisoned the node; scoped `crictl rmi` does not clear import aliases, and kubelet follows the missing alias. | `make kind-reset`, recreate the cluster, then rerun the node-native loaders. Do not attempt containerd content surgery. |
| Debezium Connect/Server pods fail create after a “successful” digest pull | Node still carries reconstructed `import-*` repoDigests from a poisoned kind node. | Same as above: reset/recreate, then `make kind-load-debezium-connect` / `make kind-load-debezium-server`. |
